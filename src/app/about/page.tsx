                This website is developed for research purposes.
                The main objective of this website is to validate attributes to reach a mood transformation based on
                the selected moods. The data, including top artists, top tracks and recommendations are provided by
                Spotify Web API. The documentation can be found <a target="_blank"
                                                                   href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">
                <u>here</u></a>.<br/>
                You can give feedback to the presented recommendations. By clicking on yes or no, the response will be
                stored in a database and can be evaluated, once a meaningful amount of responses could be collected.
                Over the time, the attributes for mood-based recommendations will be adjusted to provide more precise
                recommendations. The submitted response contains a timestamp, the selected current mood, the target mood,
                as well as the recommendation URL sent to Spotify&lsquo;s recommendation endpoint and the given answer, if
                the recommendation helps transforming the mood (yes or no). Based on that information the adjustments
                will be performed.
